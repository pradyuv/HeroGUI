## ICS4U 
# FINAL PROJECT â€“ Software Package

For your final task of the year, you will create a piece of software that will demonstrate all of the knowledge you have gained this year.  

This will be pretty wide open: you can create a computer game or any other computer programs. As long as...

- It has been created by from scratch by you

- It demonstrates the entire development process (i.e. it is not just following a tutorial and handing it in as you own)

- It demonstrates all of the topics covered so far this year


## ***Proposal & Plan:***

To show your brilliant understanding of the Software Development Cycle, it will be important to show your planning skills.

With that in mind, you will have a series of Breakout Meetings with Mr. Solonon in which we will discuss how the project is going.  

I will also be providing you with a project proposal document via the Google Classroom that will help keep you organized.  

## ***Program Requirements:***

All code must be clearly documented, neatly formatted, and must make logical and efficient use of variables.  The program should make use of all programming concepts covered in the course.

## ***Program Testing:*** 
The program should be as crash-proof as possible. Expect this to be a big part our Breakout Meetings.

## **DEADLINES**
The Final day of classes will be on ***FRIDAY, JUNE 18th***.  
I will be performing Final Evaluations starting on  ***MONDAY, JUNE 21st***,so all projects must be submitted by then.
